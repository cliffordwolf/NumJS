Real and Complex Numbers
------------------------

JavaScript does not support operator overloading. So in all arithmetric that
might involve objects other then real numbers must be performed via the
following NumJS function:

	NumJS.ADD(x, y)        .... x + y
	NumJS.SUB(x, y)        .... x - y
	NumJS.MUL(x, y)        .... x * y
	NumJS.DOT(x, y)        .... x . y
	NumJS.DIV(x, y)        .... x / y
	NumJS.POW(x, y)        .... x ^ y

	NumJS.INV(x)           .... 1/x
	NumJS.NEG(x)           .... -x
	NumJS.ABS(x)           .... abs(x)
	NumJS.NORM(x)          .... norm(x)  (euclidean norm)
	NumJS.ARG(x)           .... arg(x)
	NumJS.CONJ(x)          .... conjugate(x)
	NumJS.TRANSP(x)        .... transpose(x)
	NumJS.EXP(x)           .... e^x
	NumJS.LOG(x)           .... log(x)
	NumJS.DET(x)           .... det(x)
	NumJS.RE(x)            .... real_part(x)
	NumJS.IM(x)            .... imaginary_part(x)

	NumJS.EQ(x, y)         .... x == y
	NumJS.EQ_ABS(x, y, d)  .... x == y  (with max abs error d)
	NumJS.EQ_REL(x, y, d)  .... x == y  (with max rel error d)

Note that not all objects support all operations. Whenever an operation
is performed on objects that do not support it, a "NumJS.* type error"
exception is thrown.

The script "opmap.html" generates a table showing the allowed operand
types for each operation.

For real numbers the native JavaScript number type is used:

	var x = 1.2345;

Complex numbers can be created using the NumJS.C(re, im) helper function:

	var z = NumJS.C(1, 1);

or in polar coordinates using the NumJS.P(abs, arg) helper function:

	var z = NumJS.C(Math.PI/4, Math.sqrt(2));

Complex numbers have a .toString() method that is automatically used by
the interpreter to convert a complex number to a string when needed.


Matrices
--------

Matrices can be created using one of the following three functions:

	var realMatrix3x3    = NumJS.RM(3, 3);
	var complexMatrix3x3 = NumJS.CM(3, 3);
	var permutMatrix3x3  = NumJS.PM(3);

Real and complex matrices are initialized to all-zeros and can be filled
using the .set(row, col, value) method. Note that row and column indexes
start with 0.

Permutation Matrices are initialized to the identity matrix and can be
modified using the .pivot_col(c1, c2) and .pivot_row(r1, r2) methods,
that pivot the two specified rows or columns.

Alternatively real and complex matrices can be initialized using their
constructors by passing and additional array with the initialization
data in row-major order:

	var realFlipMatrix3x3 = NumJS.RM(3, 3, [
		0, 0, 1,
		0, 1, 0,
		1, 0, 0
	]);

Permutation matrices can also be created with initalization data. In this
case the array must contain the row-number of each '1' per column:

	var permutFlipMatrix3x3 = NumJS.PM(3, [2, 1, 0]);

There are no special vector classes. So vectors must simply be created as
Nx1 matrices.

Matrix-Matrix and Matrix-Scalar operations can be performed using the
uppercase NumJS.* metioned above and work as one would expect it. E.g.:

	var A = NumJS.RM(2, 2, [1, 2, 3, 4]);

	var B_re = NumJS.RM(2, 2, [5, 6, 7, 8]);
	var B_im = NumJS.RM(2, 2, [9, 0, 1, 2]);
	var B = NumJS.ADD(B_re, NumJS.MUL(B_im, NumJS.C(0,1)));

	var Z = NumJS.MUL(A, B);

Individal matrix elements can be accessed using the .get(row, col) method.

Note that also permutation matrices provide a .get(row, col) method, but
lack support of a .set(row, col, value) method.

A copy of a matrix can be created using the .copy() method. This method
converts permutation matrices into real matrices. If this is not the desired
behavior, use the .clone() method instead.

The dimension of a Matrix is stored in its .rows and .cols properties.
A permutation matrix has an additional .sign property that holds the
sign of the permutation.

Matrices also have a .toString() method that is automatically used by
the interpreter to convert a matrix object to a string when needed.


PA = LU factorization and solver
--------------------------------

Each Matrix object provides the functions .LU() and .PLU() that perform
an LU factorization and return a PLU object when the factorization was
successful and null if the Matrix can't be factorized.

The result of a factorization is cached. So successive callc to .LU()
or .PLU() do not introduce any significant performance problem.

The .LU() method performs LU factorization without pivoting and .PLU()
performs factorization with pivoting. In most cases factorization with
pivoting is prefered over factorization without pivoting.

The PLU object stores the factorization in the properties .P, .L and .U
with .P beeing a permutation matrix object and .L and .U beeing real
matrices if the factorized matrix was real and complex matrices otherwise.

Per definition .L is a lower triangular matrix with all ones on the main
diagonal and .U is an upper triangular matrix.
